Prepare a release based on docs/guides/releasing.md.

1. Prerequisite: Run `gh secret list` and verify that these secrets exist: `APPLE_CERTIFICATE`,
   `APPLE_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD`, `APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY`, `APPLE_API_KEY`, `APPLE_API_KEY_BASE64`, `APPLE_API_ISSUER`.
   If any are missing, warn the user and stop.
2. Update @CHANGELOG.md based on git commits since last release.
   - Read the file first to match its style.
   - Commits have title + body - read all!
   - You can link multiple commits for changelog items if needed.
   - **Get commit SHAs via `git log --format='%h' --abbrev=8`** — never extend a 7-char prefix from `git log --oneline`
     by guessing the next character. The committed changelog convention is 8 chars; let git produce them. The
     `changelog-links` check (run by the release script) will reject fabricated SHAs and abort the release.
   - **Add a `## [Unreleased]` heading** right after the format preamble (before the first versioned section), then put
     entries under it. The release script replaces this heading with the versioned one. The committed changelog has no
     `[Unreleased]` section between releases - you're creating it fresh each time.
3. Based on the changes, advise what the next version should be (patch: bug fixes, minor: new features, major: major
   launches), and give the user the `./scripts/release.sh x.x.x` command to run.
4. **Offer to run the release script** for the user. Wait for confirmation before running.
5. **Push** with `git push origin main --tags`. If the release script finished cleanly — all checks green, the release
   commit and tag created, and the working tree clean — push without asking. The push is part of the release flow the
   user already authorized by running the script. Only pause to confirm if something is off: checks were skipped or
   force-passed, the working tree has unexpected changes, or the script reported a problem.
6. **After pushing**, confirm the build started:
   - Wait ~30 seconds, then run `gh run view <release-run-id> --json jobs` and check the `Build (...)` jobs.
   - All three should go `in_progress` together — they run in parallel on GitHub-hosted `macos-latest` runners.
   - Builds run on GitHub's infrastructure, so there's no runner to babysit and **no need to keep the laptop awake**. If
     the jobs sit `queued` for minutes, that's GitHub capacity, not something to fix locally; check
     [githubstatus.com](https://www.githubstatus.com/) rather than touching `~/actions-runner-prvw`.
7. **Then start monitoring the CI build**:
   - Poll `gh run view` every few minutes in the background and report progress (which jobs are done, which are still
     running).
   - Report when all jobs complete (success or failure). If a job fails, show the failure details, and advise how to
     fix.
   - Suggest the user to also track the build at https://github.com/vdavid/prvw/actions.
8. **In parallel, watch the standalone CI run** (the non-release `CI` workflow that fires on the same push):
   - It's not a blocker for the release. If it goes red, fix it in the background while the release builds — small
     things like lint regressions are common.
   - Surface the failure to the user when convenient; don't interrupt release-build progress reporting for it.
9. **After the release run succeeds, verify the public surface**:
   - `gh release view vX.Y.Z --json assets,tagName,publishedAt` — confirm three DMGs are attached
     (`Prvw_X.Y.Z_aarch64.dmg`, `_x86_64.dmg`, `_universal.dmg`) and sizes look reasonable.
   - Wait ~30 seconds for the website auto-deploy (the release workflow commits an updated `latest.json` and fires a
     webhook), then `curl -s https://getprvw.com/latest.json | jq -r .version` and confirm it matches `X.Y.Z`.
   - If `latest.json` still shows the old version after ~2 minutes, the deploy webhook may have failed silently. Tell
     the user; the manual fix is to re-trigger the website-deploy workflow via `workflow_dispatch` from the Actions tab.
     Don't block release success on this — the GitHub Release is what users actually download.
